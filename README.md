  <h2 style="color:rgb(99, 245, 21);"> Hi thereðŸ‘‹</h2>

Iam a developer who enjoys tackling frontend challenges(im also do fullstack btw).Building stuff from scratch or improving existing code is where I shine!

I've built projects like my [Portfolio](https://bethwel-lagat.netlify.app/), tools like [Eventify:](https://shiny-buttercream-f01411.netlify.app/) and others.

Letâ€™s collaborate in open source and crate something amazing.</p>
